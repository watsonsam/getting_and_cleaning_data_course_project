# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project fulfils the requirements for the course project for week 4 of the [Coursera/Johns Hopkins University "Getting and Cleaning Data" course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome).

Using the provided [data file](getdata%252Fprojectfiles%252FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) (the original file and more information about it can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)) the run_analysis.R script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
